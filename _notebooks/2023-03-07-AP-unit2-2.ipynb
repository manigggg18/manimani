Height and width refer to the dimensions of the image. The height and width of an image determine its aspect ratio, which is the ratio of the width to the height. The number of pixels in an image is the total number of dots or points that make up the image. The more pixels an image has, the higher its resolution and the sharper and more detailed the image will appear. However, more pixels also mean a larger file size and slower performance.**\n",

It's important to consider how the images will be viewed and ensure that they are optimized accordingly.Lossy compression is a method of reducing the file size of an image by discarding some of the data that makes up the image. This can result in a significant reduction in file size, but can also result in a loss of image quality.**"

    "\n",
    "#### Adding numbers in 4-bit representation\n",
    "\n",
    "**A certain programming language uses 4-bit binary sequences to represent nonnegative integers. For example, the binary sequence 0101 represents the corresponding decimal value 5. Using this programming language, a programmer attempts to add the decimal values 14 and 15 and assign the sum to the variable total. Which of the following best describes the result of this operation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The correct sum of 29 will be assigned to the variable total.\n",
    "\n",
    "B: An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent either of the values 14 or 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "C: An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent 29, the sum of 14 and 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "D: A round-off error will occur because the decimal values 14 and 15 are represented as approximations due to the fixed number of bits used to represent numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** An overflow error will occur because 4 bits is not large enough to represent 29, the sum of 14 and 15. The largest binary value that can be represented using 4 bits is 1111, which is equal to the decimal value 15. Since the sum is larger than the largest representable value, an overflow error will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data that can be represented with binary sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which of the following are true statements about the data that can be represented using binary sequences?**\n",

    "**I. Binary sequences can be used to represent strings of characters.**\n",

    "\n",
    "C: II and III only\n",
    "\n",
    "D: I, II, and III\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I, II, and III. All digital data is represented at the lowest level as sequences of bits. Statement I is true because strings of characters can be represented by sequences of bits. Statement II is true because colors can be encoded as sequences of bits. Statement III is true because sequences of bits can be used to represent sound.\n",

    "D: Uploading the original file without using any compression algorithm\n",

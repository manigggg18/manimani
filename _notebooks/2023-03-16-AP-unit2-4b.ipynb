    "\n",
    "**A database schema is the structure of a database described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS). It is considered the “blueprint” of a database which describes how the data may relate to other tables or other data models. The schema defines how data is organized within a relational database, including logical constraints such as table names, fields, data types, and the relationships between these entities.**\n",

    "**An identity column in SQL is a column that is defined to be automatically generated by the database management system (DBMS) when a new record is inserted into the table. The purpose of an identity column is to provide a unique value for each row in the table. It is often used as a primary key for the table. The identity column is also known as an auto-increment column.**\n",

    "**A primary key in SQL is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. The purpose of a primary key is to ensure that each row in a table can be uniquely identified and to enforce the integrity of the data in the table. A primary key can be used to link tables together in a relational database.**\n",

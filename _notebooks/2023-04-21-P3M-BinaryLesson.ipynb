    "\n",
    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Bit is short for **binary** digit, and represents a value of either 0 or 1.\n",
    "    - A byte is 8 bits.\n",
    "* Sequences of bits are used to represent different things.\n",
    "    - Representing data with sequences of bits is called **abstraction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice Questions:\n",
    "1. How many bits are in 3 bytes?\n",
    "\n",
    "**24**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What digital information can be represented by bits? \n",
    "\n",
    "**0 and 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Are bits an analog or digital form of storing data? What is the difference between the two?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Digital since the data is only limited to 0 and 1.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",

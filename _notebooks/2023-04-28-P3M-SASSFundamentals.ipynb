This means when you run Sass code, you're actually converting your code to CSS. That CSS code output is then used directly by a browser.

    "- CSS is the default technology that most programmers use when styling webpage. It is one of the 3 fundamental web technologies along with HTML and JavaScript. HTML manages the structure, JavaScript makes pages interactive, and CSS changes the style by taking a markup language like HTML and describes how it should be presented to the user.\n",

    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables in SASS help programmers with storing information that they intend to use multiple times throughout the program. The key difference is that using SASS variables when coding in CSS is way more time-efficient than not using SASS. Although the code might work similarly wether the user uses variables or not, it is for certain that the process of writing the code can be accomplished way faster.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nesting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nestings in SASS help programmers with managing the structure of their CSS code in a way that it is more readable and organized. In addition, similar to using variables, nestings help with being more time-efficient. Without nesting, a CSS code segment might look very confusing and unorganized.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixins\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mixins in SASS help programmers with grouping multiple CSS calls and using them throughout the project. Similar to the features nesting and variables, mixins help with being more time-efficient. However, perhaps their most significant use when compared to CSS is the ability to pass values into mixins in order to make them more flexible.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions in SASS help programmers with implementing mathematics in their CSS code, which enables them to create procedures that receive one or more arguments and return a single value. SASS functions are very useful when it comes to writing CSS code for very large and complex projects, as they create solutions that would not be accessible without using procedures.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "**SASS allows the use of conditional statements, such as if/else statements, to dynamically generate CSS styles based on variables and conditions. In contrast, CSS does not have built-in support for conditional statements, so styles must be written directly and cannot be generated dynamically.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Sass, programmers can use loops to generate repetitive CSS code, reducing the amount of code you need to write. In contrast, CSS does not have native loop functionality, so you would need to manually write out repetitive CSS code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "**The inheritance feature in SASS helps programmers with assigning the same set of properties from a class to another class without having the need to repeat the properties. In addition, it is possible to modify certain properties. Without the inheritance feature, CSS code segments would be messier and less readable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operators in SASS allow for mathematical operations to be performed on values, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. CSS, on the other hand, does not have built-in operators for performing mathematical operations. Instead, developers have to rely on workarounds such as using JavaScript or declaring different CSS classes with different values.**\n",

<td>Problem Statement</td>
<td>A high school student can only use their phone and computer device for education and school assignments. The student’s parents have forbidden them from accessing their phone and computer device for entertainment purposes. The student needs approximately 10 minutes between assignments to do an entertaining activity in order to become fully operational again and avoid severe boredom. The student always experiences boredom during the 10-minute breaks between assignments. The student finds it necessary to find a solution, because they cannot continue operating correctly without having some source of entertainment and refreshment.</td>

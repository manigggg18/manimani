<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The message is broken into packets that are transmitted in a specified order. Each packet must be received in the order it was sent for the message to be correctly reassembled by the recipient’s device.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The message is broken into packets. The packets can be received in any order and still be reassembled by the recipient’s device.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The message is broken into two packets. One packet contains the data to be transmitted and the other packet contains metadata for routing the data to the recipient’s device.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The message is transmitted as a single file and received in whole by the recipient’s device.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The message is broken into packets. The packets can be received in any order and still be reassembled by the recipient’s device.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Messages are broken into packets. Each packet contains data to be transmitted, as well as metadata for routing and reassembling the data upon receipt. This allows the packets to be received in any order and still be reassembled correctly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Open protocols allow devices to specify how data packets are to be routed on the Internet in advance.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open protocols ensure that all data transmission on the Internet is kept secure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open protocols ensure that all Internet users are provided connections with equal bandwidth.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open protocols provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My Answer :</strong> Open protocols allow devices to specify how data packets are to be routed on the Internet in advance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Routing on the Internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> Open protocols provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Protocols are agreed-upon sets of rules that specify the behavior of a system. Protocols used on the Internet enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate in a standard way.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The World Wide Web is a protocol that is accessed using a data stream called the Internet.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The World Wide Web is a Web site that is accessed using a protocol called the Internet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files that is accessed via a network called the Internet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Internet is an interconnected network of networks, and the World Wide Web is an information system that is accessed via the Internet.</p>

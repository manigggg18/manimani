            CollegeBoard clearly states that the video and the written response should state the program's purpose, not its functionality. The video is also extremely short and incomplete.

            All requirements are met. Code segments are provided and the specified material is further explored in the written response. The written response includes two clearly distinguishable program code segments, which are disjointed code segments or two parts of a contiguous code segment.

            The student adequately describes two calls to the selected procedure. As required by College Board, each call passes a different argument that naturally causes a different segment of code.

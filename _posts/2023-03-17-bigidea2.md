## Reflection

Overall, I would say that this quiz was extremely easy. However, I still find working with operators difficult, and to be perfectly blunt, I do not even understand them. So, I had to search up a couple of questions that had operators in them. I believe that I need to study them in order to prepare for the AP exam.

## Missed Questions

### Q10 Combine data sources

#### Each student at a school has a unique student ID number. A teacher has the following spreadsheets available.

- #### Spreadsheet I contains information on all students at the school. For each entry in this spreadsheet, the student name, the student ID, and the studentâ€™s grade point average are included.

- #### Spreadsheet II contains information on only students who play at least one sport. For each entry in this spreadsheet, the student ID and the names of the sports the student plays are included.

- #### Spreadsheet III contains information on only students whose grade point average is greater than 3.5. For each entry in this spreadsheet, the student name and the student ID are included.

- #### Spreadsheet IV contains information on only students who play more than one sport. For each entry in this spreadsheet, the student name and the student ID are included.

#### The teacher wants to determine whether students who play a sport are more or less likely to have higher grade point averages than students who do not play any sports. Which of the following pairs of spreadsheets can be combined and analyzed to determine the desired information?

**A: Spreadsheets I and II**

**B: Spreadsheets I and IV**

**C: Spreadsheets II and III**

**D: Spreadsheets III and IV**

**My Answer:** Spreadsheets II and III

> **The desired information cannot be determined with these two spreadsheets because students with grade point averages of 3.5 or less cannot be identified.**

**Correct Answer:** Spreadsheets I and II

> **The desired information can be determined by using the student IDs in spreadsheet II to identify the students who play a sport. Once the students who play a sport are identified, the grade point averages of students who play sports in spreadsheet I can be compared to the grade point averages of all other students in spreadsheet I.**

### First Attempt

I tried to change the theme and as a result the CI status changed from "passing" to "failing". My page also didn't look any different.

### Second Attempt

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Screenshot 2022-09-06 111520.png)

It worked but some posts looked very off-putting.

So I changed it back to the default theme.

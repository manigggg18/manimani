# Section 3 Video 3 Notes and Planning

## Arithmetic Operations in Programming

> [Link to Video](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/103/home?apd=mo45c6udmh)

#### Arithmetic operations exist in most programming languages.

#### Include: Subtraction, Addition, Multiplication, Division, Getting the Remainder

- #### All operations are represented by symbols.

- **Subtraction: "-"**

- Ex: `a - b`

- **Addition: "+"**

- Ex: `a + b`

- **Multiplication: "*"**

- Ex: `a * b`

- **Division: /**

- Ex: `a / b`

- **Getting the Remainder: MOD**

- Ex: `a MOD b`

#### In all of these scenarios, a/b can be an expression or just a simple number.

#### Just like how numbers can be assigned to variables, a set of operations involving different values and numbers can also be assigned to a variable

**Ex:** 

`num1 ← 20`

`num2 ← num1 + 98`

`num3 ← num2 * num1 + 8 / num2`

> Arithmetic operations in programming are performed in the same order as operations in mathematics. For example, operations in parentheses should be done first.

## Idea for Hacks 

#### A series of challenges and problems in the form of a quiz including arithmetic operations and expressions.

### Possible Options: Students will clone a fastpages repository in order to complete the given assignments and interact with different elements.

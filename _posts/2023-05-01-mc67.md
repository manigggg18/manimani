## Overview

Overall, I would say that I did pretty good. I definitely need more practice since it took me a relatively long time to answer each question. However, the main problem was the density of the questions. In other words, as I reached the final 5-10 questions of the test, my attention span became non-existent. So I need to get used to answering 50 questions in a relatively short amount of time.

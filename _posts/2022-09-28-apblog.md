## 1.2 (3/6)

### Q1: Consider the following code segment.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/ssss.png)

### Which of the following best describes the behavior of the code segment?

**My Response:** The code segment displays the value of  2(5×3)  by initializing result to 2 and then multiplying result by 5 a total of three times.



> Initializing result to 2 and multiplying it by 5 a total of three times yields 2(53), not 2(5×3).



**Correct Response:** The code segment displays the value of  2(53)  by initializing result to 2 and then multiplying result by 5 a total of three times.

###  Q5: A student wrote the following code segment, which displays true if the list myList contains any duplicate values and displays false otherwise.

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/aaaa.png)

### The code segment compares pairs of list elements, setting containsDuplicates to true if any two elements are found to be equal in value. Which of the following best describes the behavior of how pairs of elements are compared?

**My Response:** The code segment iterates through myList, comparing each element to the element that immediately follows it in the list.



> The inner loop iterates from index j + 1 to the end of the list, so each element is compared with the all elements that follow it, not just the one element that immediately follows it.



**Correct Response:** The code segment iterates through myList, comparing each element to all subsequent elements in the list.

### Q6: A student is creating an application that allows customers to order food for delivery from a local restaurant. Which of the following is LEAST likely to be an input provided by a customer using the application?

**My Response:** The name of a food item to be included in the delivery



> The name of a food item is input that needs to be provided by the customer in order for the order to be completed.

## 1.3 (2/3)

### Q1: In the following procedure, the parameter max is a positive integer.

`PROCEDURE printNums(max)`

`{`

`    count ← 1`
    
`    REPEAT UNTIL(count > max)`

`    {`

`        DISPLAY(count)`

`        count ← count + 2`

`    }`

`}`

### Which of the following is the most appropriate documentation to appear with the printNums procedure?

**My Response:** Prints all positive odd integers that are greater than max.



> The loop terminates when count exceeds max, so only values less than or equal to max are printed.



**Correct Response:** Prints all positive odd integers that are less than or equal to max.

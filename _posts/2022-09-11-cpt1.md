title: CPT Initial Concept

**Individual/Collaboration:** Undecided 

**Language:** Python or JavaScript

**Goals:**

- Final program code (created independently or collaboratively)

- A video that displays the running of your program and demonstrates functionality you developed (created independently)

- Written responses to all the prompts in the performance task (created independently)

**Plan:**

I'm planning to design a simple yet creative game, though I'm still not sure what development program I'm going to use.

My initial concept is a time based game. The user has to click/press a key for a specified number of times before the time runs out. I'm planning to implement a code that makes the game harder after each "level".

**Design:**

I'm still working on it, but my initial design concept is in the form of a "loading screen". The "loading screen" gets filled with each click.

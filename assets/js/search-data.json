In this data example, we are going to make &quot;the best computer jokes ever ;)&quot; and serve them over the Internet. The ultimate objective is to allow our viewers to provide a like or dislike on each of our jokes. . This code planning begins by coming up with some jokes and defining a data &quot;model&quot; to keep and manage the jokes. . jokes_data contains a list of dictionary records containing joke and reactions:haha or boohoo - joke_list contains collection of jokes we will put into jokes_data | . | Next comes some functions to interact with our jokes . def initJokes(): initializes jokes_data | def getJokes(): returns the complete list of jokes | def getJoke(): returns a single joke from our list | ... many more function can be examined by reading comments below ... | . | . import random jokes_data = [] joke_list = [ &quot;If you give someone a program... you will frustrate them for a day; if you teach them how to program... you will &quot; &quot;frustrate them for a lifetime.&quot;, &quot;Q: Why did I divide sin by tan?

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs.

As always, I’m still learning and there’s much room for improvement. . . . . Questions . 1.4 (2/3) . . Q1 (Correct): In the following code segment, score and penalty are initially positive integers. The code segment is intended to reduce the value of score by penalty. However, if doing so would cause score to be negative, score should be assigned the value 0. For example, if score is 20 and penalty is 5, the code segment should set score to 15. If score is 20 and penalty is 30, score should be set to 0. The code segment does not work as intended. . Line 1: IF(score - penalty &lt; 0) . Line 2: { . Line 3: score ← score - penalty . Line 4: } . Line 5: ELSE . Line 6: { . Line 7: score ← 0 . Line 8: } . Which of the following changes can be made so that the code segment works as intended? . Answer: Interchaning lines 3 and 7. . Interchanging lines 3 and 7 ensures that if reducing score by penalty results in a negative value, score is set to 0. Otherwise, score is reduced by penalty. . . Q2 (Incorrect): The following procedure is intended to return true if the list of numbers myList contains only positive numbers and is intended to return false otherwise. The procedure does not work as intended. . PROCEDURE allPositive(myList) . { . index ← 1 . len ← LENGTH(myList) . REPEAT len TIMES . { . IF(myList[index] &gt; 0) . { . RETURN(true) . } . index ← index + 1 . } . RETURN(false) . } . My Answer : [1, 2, 3] . The procedure begins to traverse the list and immediately encounters the positive value 1. At this point, the procedure returns true as intended for this list. . Correct Answer: [-1, 0, 1] . The procedure traverses this list and eventually encounters the positive value 1. At this point, the procedure returns true when it should return false because the list does not contain only positive values. . . Q3 (Correct): A homework assignment consists of 10 questions. The assignment is graded as follows. . . Let numCorrect represent the number of correct answers for a particular student. The following code segment is intended to display the appropriate grade based on numCorrect. The code segment does not work as intended in all cases. . . For which of the following values of numCorrect does the code segment NOT display the intended grade? . Answer(s): 8: When numCorrect is 8, the condition numCorrect &gt; 7 evaluates to true and the condition numCorrect ≥ 9 evaluates to false. Therefore “check minus” is displayed instead of the intended “check plus”. . 6: When numCorrect is 6, the condition numCorrect &gt; 7 evaluates to false. Therefore “check” is displayed instead of the intended “check minus”. . . . Click here to access additional resources for Collaboration, Program Function/Purpose, and Program Design/Development. .",

My Response: The code segment displays the value of 2(5×3) by initializing result to 2 and then multiplying result by 5 a total of three times. . Initializing result to 2 and multiplying it by 5 a total of three times yields 2(53), not 2(5×3). . Correct Response: The code segment displays the value of 2(53) by initializing result to 2 and then multiplying result by 5 a total of three times. . . Q5: A student wrote the following code segment, which displays true if the list myList contains any duplicate values and displays false otherwise. . . The code segment compares pairs of list elements, setting containsDuplicates to true if any two elements are found to be equal in value. Which of the following best describes the behavior of how pairs of elements are compared? . My Response: The code segment iterates through myList, comparing each element to the element that immediately follows it in the list. . The inner loop iterates from index j + 1 to the end of the list, so each element is compared with the all elements that follow it, not just the one element that immediately follows it. .

The quiz includes 3 multiple-choice questions and 1 free-response question. Working with different elements such as buttons and images was easy for the most part and didn’t present any challenges. Making the free response question was a bit tricky. I had to play around with its assigned block and the text input function to make it work. . # Default Notation . onEvent(&quot;textinput&quot;, &quot;change&quot;, function(event) { . }); . # My Edit . onEvent(&quot;text_input1&quot;, &quot;change&quot;, function(event) { . }); . .

The trickiest part of developing this quiz was displaying the final score at the end. I used a variables and individual functions to make it work.

            "content": "Background . Too often we think the goal of a laboratory is to “get an answer”. Just as a graph with one point does not tell us much, calculating a single value can be misleading. Although the accuracy of this value can be determined if a standard value is known, the precision or reproducibility cannot. One way to picture this precision is to graph the data and fit the data points with a best fit line. A best fit line should be drawn with as many points above it as below it, the closer the data points are to the line the more precise and reliable your results. . The equation describing the graph also shows how variables are related, allowing new values to be extrapolated or calculated from the graph. An additional step called “linearizing” helps determine the functional relationship between variables. . The objective of the linearizing process is to change the independent or dependent variable, for example change x to 1/x, so that the resulting graph is linear. So then, the equation describing the linear graph becomes; . y = slope (1/x) + intercept . Credits to Mr. Liao .",

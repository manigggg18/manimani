            "content": "3.17: Algorithm Efficiency . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to help students understand how to make an efficient program and optimize it and understand its importance to the CSP curriculum. . What is Algorithmic Efficiency? . The ability of an algorithm to solve a problem in an efficient way An efficient algorithm solves a problem quickly and with a minimum amount of resources, such as time and memory. | . | How do we determine if an algorithm is efficient or not? One way we can do this is by determining the time complexity of the algorithm. | Another way is through space complexity. | . | . Traveling Merchant Problem Hacks: . What did you and your team discuss? (record below) . An heuristic solution is an approach to a problem that produces a solution that isn&#39;t necessarily optimal but can be used when normal methods take forever | . Describe the method used to solve the traveling merchant problem. (record below) . 3.18: Undecidable Problems . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A decidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An undecidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(2600000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)) print(divideThirteen(366699999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999996)) . True True . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1. Note that the computer runs forever. while i == 0: number += 1 if integerTest(number) == False: i +=1 print(&quot;Done&quot;) . The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an undecidable problem. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is no way to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the code runs forever, so HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is “halts”. It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of “never”. | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem. Explain why it is considered an undecidable problem. . One situation in which a computer may run into an undecidable problem is when it is trying to determine whether a given program will run forever or eventually halt. This is known as the halting problem and it is considered an undecidable problem because it has been proven that there is no algorithm that can accurately determine the behavior of all possible programs. In other words, there are certain programs for which it is impossible to predict whether they will halt or run indefinitely. This means that in some cases, a computer may be unable to solve a problem because it is undecidable. . 3.17 Homework . Your homework for Algorithmic Efficiency is pretty simple. .

You can do this using standard HTML table elements, such as &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, and &lt;td&gt;. . | Next, you’ll need to retrieve the highest scores data from your backend system. This data is usually stored in a database, and you can use a server-side language (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby) to query the database and retrieve the data. The server-side script should then encode the data in JSON format and return it to the client (your website). . | Once the data is returned to the client, you can use jQuery to parse the JSON data and display it on the HTML table. You can do this by making an AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) request to the server-side script and using the $.getJSON method to retrieve the JSON data. . | Finally, you can use jQuery to append the data to the appropriate cells in the HTML table. You can use the .append() method to add the data as a new child element to the table cells. Method 1: . | Step 3 . Method 1 . To retrieve the JSON data from the server-side script, you can use an AJAX request. AJAX allows you to make requests to the server and update a specific part of the webpage without reloading the entire page. . Here’s an example of how you can make an AJAX request using jQuery: . $.ajax({ url: &#39;server-side-script.php&#39;, dataType: &#39;json&#39;, success: function(data) { // data contains the JSON data returned by the server } }); . Method 2 . You can also use the $.getJSON method, which is a shorthand for making an AJAX request and expecting a JSON response: . $.getJSON(&#39;server-side-script.php&#39;, function(data) { // data contains the JSON data returned by the server }); . In both examples, the server-side-script.php file is the server-side script that retrieves the data from the database and returns it in JSON format. . Step 4 . Once you have the JSON data, you can use jQuery to append it to the HTML table. Here’s an example of how you can do this: . $.getJSON(&#39;server-side-script.php&#39;, function(data) { // Iterate through the data and append it to the table $.each(data, function(index, item) { $(&#39;#table-body&#39;).append( &#39;&lt;tr&gt;&#39; + &#39;&lt;td&gt;&#39; + item.name + &#39;&lt;/td&gt;&#39; + &#39;&lt;td&gt;&#39; + item.score + &#39;&lt;/td&gt;&#39; + &#39;&lt;/tr&gt;&#39; ); }); }); . In this example, #table-body is the ID of the &lt;tbody&gt; element in the HTML table, and item.name and item.score are the name and score of the player, respectively. . Game Research .

            "content": "Libraries . A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. | These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. | A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc. | . Why are libraries important? . Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. | One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. | Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc. | . A few libraries that simplify coding processes: . Pillow allows you to work with images. | Tensor Flow helps with data automation and monitors performance. | Matplotlib allows you to make 2D graphs and plots. | . The AP Exam Refrence Sheet itself is a library! . Hacks: . Research two other Python Libraries NOT DISCUSSED DURING LESSON and make a markdown post, explaining their function and how it helps programmers code. . API&#8217;s . An Application Program Interface, or API, contains specific direction for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | An API acts as a gateway for the imported procedures from a library to interact with the rest of your code. | . Activity: Walkthrough with NumPy . Install NumPy on VSCode: Open New Terminal In VSCode: | pip3 install --upgrade pip | pip install numpy | | . REMEMBER: When running library code cells use Python Interpreter Conda (Version 3.9.12) . Example of using NumPy for arrays: . import numpy as np new_matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]) print (new_matrix) . [[1 2 3] [4 5 6] [7 8 9]] .

Polynomial function, f(x): 2 2 x + 1 Derivative, f(x)&#39;= 4 x When x=5 f(x)&#39;= 20 . Random Values . Random number generation (RNG) produces a random number (crazy right?) This means that a procedure with RNG can return different values even if the parameters (inputs) do not change | . | CollegeBoard uses RANDOM(A, B), to return an integer between integers A and B. RANDOM(1, 10) can output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 | In Python, this would be random.randint(A, B), after importing Python&#39;s &quot;random&quot; library (import random) | JavaScript&#39;s works a little differently, with Math.random() returning a value between 0 and 1. To match Python and CollegeBoard, you could make a procedure like this | . | . | . CollegeBoard Example: What is the possible range of values for answ3 .

A simulation is a tested scenario used for viewing results/outputs to prepare for them in real world situations . | These can be used for games like dice rolling, spinners, etc . | These can be used for practical things such as building structures, testing car crashes, and other things before engaging in them in the real world . | These simulations can have the option of obeying real world physics (Gravity, collision) or they can go against these norms since this is a fictitious scenario, and couldn&#39;t happen in real life . | . Big Question . Which of the following simulations could be the LEAST useful? . | A retailer trying to identify which products sold the most . | A restaurant determining the efficiency of robots | An insurance company studying the rain impact of cars | A sports bike company studying design changes to their new bike design | . If you guessed a bike company, you&#39;re wrong, because the retail simulation was the right answer. Simulating robots in food service, sudying rain impact on vehicles, and new bike design can contribute a lot more to society in comparison to seeing what products sell more than others. | . Next Big Question . If you were making a simulation for making a new train station, which of the following would be true about this simulation? . It could reveal potential problems/safety issues before construction starts | It cannot be used to test the train station in different weather | Simulation will add high costs to projects | Simulation is not needed because this train station already exists | . Potential Saftey was the right answer, because you need somewhere to test the safety and ethicness of what you&#39;re about to do before you start building it. Otherwise, let&#39;s just say you&#39;ll have a special plaque for FBI&#39;s Most Wanted | . Simulation 1: . Both programs below do the same thing. Given a height and a weight, they calculate how long it will take for a object to fall to the ground in a vacuum subjected to normal Earth levels of gravity. . However, the second one is a simulation. It calculates the distance the object has fallen every 0.1 seconds. This is useful for if you wanted a visual representation of a falling object, which pure math can&#39;t do as smoothly. . height = float(input(&quot;height in meters?&quot;)) weight = input(&quot;weight in pounds?&quot;) stuff = (2 * (height / 9.8))**(1/2) print(&quot;It will take&quot;, stuff,&quot;seconds for an object that weighs&quot;,weight,&quot;pounds&quot;,&quot;to fall &quot;,height,&quot;meters in a vacuum&quot;) . It will take 1.0101525445522108 seconds for an object that weighs 4 pounds to fall 5.0 meters in a vacuum . t = 0 g = 0 d = 0 false = True while false: t = t + 0.1 d = 9.8 / 2 * (t**2) if d &gt;= height: false = False #print(d) # if you want to print the distance every time it calculates it. Too long to output to a terminal, but this could be useful to display graphically. #print(t) print(t) print(d) . 1.0999999999999999 5.928999999999999 . Simulation 2: . This simulation is made in order to simulate movement on a 2d plane vs a 3d plane. . | How it works: we have multiple variables, if statements and equations under a while command in order to randomy generate steps on a 2d plane. Once it reaches the set destination, it will say that the man made it home after x amount of steps. . | For the 3D plane, it takes a lot longer due to how big and open the 3d environment is, so there are more if statements in the 3d plane . | . (explain further) . import random x = 0 y = 0 nights = 0 turn = 0 stopped = 0 turns = [] while (nights &lt; 100): step = random.randrange(4) if step == 0: x = x+1 if step == 1: x = x-1 if step == 2: y = y+1 if step == 3: y = y-1 turn = turn + 1 if x == 0 and y == 0: nights = nights + 1 print(&quot;The Man Has Made It Home After &quot;, turn, &quot;Turns&quot;) turns.append(turn) turn = 0 if turn/1000 % 1000 == 0 and x + y != 0: print(&quot;(&quot;, x,y, &quot;)&quot;) if (turn &gt; 10000000): stopped = stopped + 1 turn = 0 x = 0 y = 0 nights = nights + 1 print(&quot;Caped&quot;) average = sum(turns) / len(turns) print(&quot;Avaerage&quot;, average, &quot;Ones that when&#39;t too long &quot;, stopped) . import random x = 0 y = 0 z = 0 nights = 0 turn = 0 stopped = 0 turns = [] while (nights &lt; 100): #rando movement step = random.randrange(6) if step == 0: x = x+1 if step == 1: x = x-1 if step == 2: y = y+1 if step == 3: y = y-1 if step == 4: z = z+1 if step == 5: z = z-1 #Turn counter turn = turn + 1 #Goal check if x == 0 and y == 0 and z == 0: nights = nights + 1 print(&quot;The Bird Has Made It Home After &quot;, turn, &quot;Turns&quot;) turns.append(turn) turn = 0 if turn/1000 % 1000 == 0 and x + y + z != 0: print(&quot;(&quot;, x,y, &quot;) &quot;,&quot;| &quot;, z) #Too long Stoper if (turn &gt; 10000000): stopped = stopped + 1 turn = 0 x = 0 y = 0 z = 0 nights = nights + 1 print(&quot;Caped&quot;) average = sum(turns) / len(turns) print(&quot;Avaerage&quot;, average,&quot;Ones that when&#39;t too long &quot;, stopped) . Simulations in the wild . Simulations are used extremely frequently in real life applications. One of the most common examples of simulations are video games. A games physics engine can accurately simulate objects colliding . Another example is Blender, the software used in 3d animations class, here at Del Norte. Blender is made up of many small simulations, but one big one it uses is simulating the way light bounces off of and interacts with objects. . HW !!! . There are several video game engines that can use simulations created with Python. Some examples include the Unreal Engine, CryEngine, and the Panda3D game engine. Python can be used to create complex simulations for use in video games, and many game developers use it for this purpose. Some game engines even have built-in support for Python, making it easy to integrate Python simulations into your game. . Other examples include the popular Unreal Engine and Unity, as well as CryEngine and Godot. Python can be used to create game logic, AI, and other gameplay elements in these engines. It can also be used for scripting and automating tasks, such as building levels or performing analytics on game data. . Using Python to create simulations for video games has several advantages. Python is a high-level language, which means that it is easy to read and understand. This makes it a good choice for developing complex simulations that would be difficult to implement in a lower-level language. Additionally, Python has a large and active community of users, which means that there are many resources available to help developers create simulations using the language. . Overall, the use of Python for creating simulations in video games allows developers to create complex and realistic environments and scenarios in their games, enhancing the player experience. . . pos = 50 # The ball is initially 50 units above the ground vel = 10 # The ball is initially moving upwards at a velocity of 10 units/second # Define the acceleration due to gravity g = -9.8 # The acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s^2 downwards # Define the timestep (the interval at which we will update the position of the ball) dt = 0.1 # We will update the position of the ball every 0.1 seconds # Define a variable to keep track of the time time = 0 # Define the main loop of the simulation while True: # Update the position of the ball using the formula: # pos = pos + vel * dt pos = pos + vel * dt # Update the velocity of the ball using the formula: # vel = vel + g * dt vel = vel + g * dt # If the ball hits the ground (if its position is less than or equal to 0), reverse its direction if pos &lt;= 0: vel = -vel # Increment the time by the timestep time = time + dt # Print the current position and velocity of the ball print(f&quot;Time: {time:.1f} s | Position: {pos:.1f} m | Velocity: {vel:.1f} m/s&quot;) # End the simulation after 5 seconds if time &gt;= 5: break .

            "content": "Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | . Slide 3: . Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. | The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. | Convert the following psuedocode to python | . def convertFahrenheit(temperature): celsius = temperature - 32 celsius = celsius * 5 / 9 return celsius outsideTemp = input(&quot;What is the temperature Outside?&quot;) print(convertFahrenheit(int(outsideTemp))) . -14.444444444444445 . Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. . What would be a good name for this procedure? | What parameters do we need for this procedure? | Try writing this procedure out in python based on the given pseudocode | . quizAvg = 74 currentSc = 35 totalPts = 40 def tempAvg(): tempAvg = currentSc / totalPts tempAvg = tempAvg * 100 if tempAvg &gt; quizAvg: quizAvg = tempAvg print(quizAvg) . Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity | A procedural abstraction may abstract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a prewritten procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial | . Complexity Example . One of the biggest advantages of procedural abstraction is managing complexity. . Think about the process of simplifying the code?

            "content": "Unit 2 . Bits . A bit (binary digit) is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store. A bit is always in one of two physical states, similar to an on/off light switch. The state is represented by a single binary value, usually a 0 or 1. . Bytes . In most computer systems, a byte is a unit of data that is eight binary digits long. A byte is the unit most computers use to represent a character such as a letter, number or typographic symbol. Each byte can hold a string of bits that need to be used in a larger unit for application purposes. . Hexadecimal / Nibbles . Hexadecimal is a numbering system with base 16. It can be used to represent large numbers with fewer digits. In this system there are 16 symbols or possible digit values from 0 to 9, followed by six alphabetic characters -- A, B, C, D, E and F. . In computing and digital technology, a nibble is four consecutive binary digits or half of an 8-bit byte. When referring to a byte, it is either the first four bits or the last four bits, which is why a nibble is sometimes referred to as a half-byte. . Binary Numbers: . Unsigned Integer . Unsigned Integers (often called &quot;units&quot;) are just like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don&#39;t have a + or - sign associated with them. Thus they are always non-negative (zero or positive). We use uint&#39;s when we know the value we are counting will always be non-negative. . Signed Integer . A signed integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range [-2147483648 to 2147483647]. An unsigned integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes a nonnegative integer in the range [0 to 4294967295]. The signed integer is represented in twos complement notation. . Floating Point . A floating point number, is a positive or negative whole number with a decimal point. For example, 5.5, 0.25, and -103.342 are all floating point numbers, while 91, and 0 are not. Floating point numbers get their name from the way the decimal point can &quot;float&quot; to any position necessary. . Binary Data Abstractions: . Boolean . A data type that has one of two possible values which is intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra. . Unicode/ASCII . Unicode and ASCII are the most popular character encoding standards that are currently being used all over the world. Unicode is the universal character encoding used to process, store and facilitate the interchange of text data in any language while ASCII is used for the representation of text such as symbols, letters, digits, etc. in computers. . RGB . Colors in a computer program are represented by combining 3 &quot;pigments&quot;. These pigments are Red, Green, and Blue (which contrasts with the &quot;primary&quot; colors we are used to as a child). By combining some amount of Red, some amount of Green, and some amount of Blue, any (displayable) color can be achieved. . Variables . A variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. Typically, a program consists of instruction s that tell the computer what to do and data that the program uses when it is running. . Data Types . A data type is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. Most programming languages support various types of data, including integer, real, character or string, and Boolean. . Assignment Operators . Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. . Lists . A list is a sequence of several variables, grouped together under a single name. Instead of writing a program with many variables x0 , x1 , x2 , … you can define a single variable x and access its members x[0] , x[1] , x[2] , etc. . 2D Lists . A 2D array in python is a two-dimensional data structure stored linearly in the memory. It means that it has two dimensions, the rows, and the columns, and thus it also represents a matrix. . Dictionaries . A dictionary is also called a hash, a map, a hashmap in different programming languages. The keys in a dictionary must be simple types (such as integers or strings) while the values can be of any type. Different languages enforce different type restrictions on keys and values in a dictionary. . Class . In object-oriented programming , a class is a template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of object . Thus, an object is a specific instance of a class; it contains real values instead of variables. The class is one of the defining ideas of object-oriented programming. . Algorithms . A programming algorithm is a procedure or formula used for solving a problem. It is based on conducting a sequence of specified actions in which these actions describe how to do something, and your computer will do it exactly that way every time. An algorithm works by following a procedure, made up of inputs. . Sequence . In programming, sequence is a basic algorithm: A set of logical steps carried out in order. Computers need instructions in the form of an algorithm in order to complete a desired task, and this algorithm must have the correct order of steps, or sequence. . Selection . Selection is a programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met. In programming, there are occasions when a decision needs to be made. Selection is the process of making a decision. The result of the decision determines which path the program will take next. . Iteration . In programming specifically, iterative refers to a sequence of instructions or code being repeated until a specific end result is achieved. Iterative development is sometimes called circular or evolutionary development. . Expressions . In programming language terminology, an “expression” is a combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler to create a new value, as opposed to a “statement” which is just a standalone unit of execution and doesn&#39;t return anything. . Comparison Operators . Comparison operators can compare numbers or strings and perform evaluations. Expressions that use comparison operators do not return a number value as do arithmetic expressions. Comparison expressions return either 1 , which represents true, or 0 , which represents false. . Truth Tables . A truth table is a display of the inputs to, and the output of a Boolean function organized as a table where each row gives one combination of input values and the corresponding value of the function. . Characters . The character in computer programming is an essential category of variable or constant that is defined and dealt with in code. . Strings . A string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). . Length . It takes a string as a parameter and returns an integer as the length of that string. . Concatenation . Concatenation, in the context of programming, is the operation of joining two strings together. The term &quot;concatenation&quot; literally means to merge two things together. . Upper . The upper() method converts all lowercase characters in a string into uppercase characters and returns it. . Lower . The lower() method returns a string where all characters are lower case. Symbols and Numbers are ignored. . Traversing Strings . For strings this means that we would like to process one character at a time. Often we start at the beginning, select each character in turn, do something to it, and continue until the end. This pattern of processing is called a traversal. . Python If . If statements are logical blocks used within programming. They&#39;re conditional statements that tell a computer what to do with certain information. In other words, they let a program make &#39;decisions&#39; while it&#39;s running. They&#39;re comprised of a minimum of two parts, &#39;if&#39; and &#39;then&#39;. . Elif . In Python, elif is short for &quot;else if&quot; and is used when the first if statement isn&#39;t true, but you want to check for another condition. Meaning, if statements pair up with elif and else statements to perform a series of checks. . Else conditionals . Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true. Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false. Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false. . Nested Selection Statements . Nested selection structures are used when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a task. Nesting is a programming activity, in which one program block is placed inside other program block of the same operation type. . Python For . A &quot;For&quot; Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code a known number of times. For example, if we want to check the grade of every student in the class, we loop from 1 to that number. When the number of times is not known before hand, we use a &quot;While&quot; loop. . While loops with Range . It can. You never change the value of x so it&#39;s always in the range. What does &quot;use a while loop on a range&quot; even mean? If it means &quot;iterate over the range&quot;, then the answer is &quot;because that&#39;s what for loops are for&quot;. . While loops with List . You can loop through the list items by using a while loop. Use the len() function to determine the length of the list, then start at 0 and loop your way through the list items by referring to their indexes. . Combining loops with conditionals to Break . Within the for loop, there is an if statement that presents the condition that if the variable number is equivalent to the integer 5, then the loop will break. Within the loop is also a print() statement that will execute with each iteration of the for loop until the loop breaks, since it is after the break statement. . Continue . Break statement stops the entire process of the loop. Continue statement only stops the current iteration of the loop. Break also terminates the remaining iterations. Continue doesn&#39;t terminate the next iterations; it resumes with the successive iterations. . Procedural Abstraction . Procedural abstraction is when we write code sections which are generalised by having variable parameters. The idea is that we have code which can cope with a variety of different situations, depending on how its parameters are set when it is called. . Python Def procedures . A Function is a series of Python statements begins by a def , followed by the function name and enclosed in parenthesis. A Function may or may not return a value. A Function procedure can take arguments (constants, variables, or expressions that are passed by a calling procedure). . Parameters . A parameter is a named variable passed into a function. Parameter variables are used to import arguments into functions. For example: function example(parameter) { console. . Return Values . A return is a value that a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task. A return value can be any one of the four variable types: handle, integer, object, or string.

            "content": "3.9 Part 1 . The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is. . 3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed. . Lesson 1 | Defining Algorithms . What is an algorithm? An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can your imagination and create whatever you wan with your own instructions! . Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks . | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. . | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) . | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. . | . Example 1 | What happens if we test the algorithm with different outputs? . The pseudocode above is translated to python for you. . Record what your outputs are when you enter 95 degrees F, does the algorithm yield the same result? . The conditional below is nested . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then Input 95, what do you notice? . NOW RECORD with another output . Record what your outputs are when you enter 54, does the algorithm yield the same result this time? . *Now use 95 as an input for the two code blocks above. . Even though an algorithm&#39;s code can look the same, you have to be careful, they can always yield different results. When constructing algorithms you want to make sure that your code corresponds with what you want as your output. You set the limit of your code and you decide what the code&#39;s output is. . Conditionals vs. Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Exercise . Learning how to utilize conditionals and booleans are important for developing algorithms. Use this exercise to help you. . Can either Boolean expression on the right replace the conditional on the left? Assume isWeekday and isHoliday are Boolean variables. . *NOTE = you can edit the variables to check the conditions needed! . IsHoliday = False IsWeekday = True if IsHoliday: driveWork = True else: if IsWeekday: driveWork = True else: driveWork = False print(driveWork) . Logically thinking about conditionals and booleans . Now the problem may seem confusing, but the best way to develop an algorithm is to think about all the possible results that can be potentially be outputted. . So if IsHoliday is set to true, then driveWork is automatically equal to false and it does not matter what value of isWeekday is. This must mean that one of the conditionals must be NOT IsHoliday. . In the case that lets say IsHoliday is set to false, then the variable for weekday needs to be checked. If it&#39;s true then driveWork is true, if it&#39;s false then driveWork is false. This must mean that the other conditional isWeekday. . Combining both conditionals, you get option 2, which is not IsHoliday and IsWeekday. This is why option 2 is right! . Example 3 | Conditionals vs Booleans . The following algorithms are intended to sum the odd numbers from 1-9. Which algorithms work as intended? . Below, I have translated the block code into python, import this to your jupyter notebook and record the result. What do you notice? . First block . sum = 1 counter = 3 #iteration var = 0 while (var &lt; 4): #while the var is &lt;= 4, it executes those commands, once it exceeds it hits the else command sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 var = var + 1 # now go through the whole thing 4 times, this is an iteration, a vital part of algorithms. else: print(sum) . Second block . sum = 0 counter = 9 #iteration while (counter &gt;= 1): sum = sum + counter counter = counter - 2 print(sum) . When we start our initializing left sum as 1 counter as 3 we had no iterations yet. Remember we&#39;re going to have to repeat this four times because the block code prompts us to repeat 4 times, so we iterate. So as we go through and follow what the block gives us. . So you see that the sum does work, it does sum up the odd numbers from 1-9 . Now lets look at the right block. . Sum is set to 0 Counter is set to 9 We must repeat until the counter &lt; 1 is true. . So we keep adding until -1, that is when the counter &lt; 1 is true, so we stop . So why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same task? . An algorithm is beautiful that way, just because you think of solving a problem differently, doesn&#39;t mean your wrong, . 3.9 Part 2 . Flowcharts . Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . How To Set Up A Flowchart . label the start point . | Define any and all variables you may need . | Consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is yes (or true) . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is no (or false) . Steps 3-5 are the steps to creating code that uses a process called selection (you can convert the question from step 3 to a conditional if-statement in code) | . | Write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly . | You may want your algorithm to iterate some steps until a condition is met . You can write the steps that need to be repeated, then draw an arrow from the last step to a step above that contains a conditional statement | . | determine a way to reach the end goal | Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | . | . | Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Example A . Consider this situation: . You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket . | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off . | There is another sale on produce for 20% off . | These sales are mutually exclusive . | Tax on all items is 8% . | . | Your TASK: . Create a flowchart for an algorithm that can be used to calculate the cost of your favorite item | . | . Example A Possible Solution (using Selection) . 3.9 Part 3 . For Algorithms How to combine and/or modify an existing algorithm. | . | . Benefits of combining algorithms can reduce development time, testing time, and simplify the identification of errors. | . | . Example in Class . Rules . step/rule 1: start with any positive integer | step/rule 2: if the preceding term is even; divide by 2 | step/rule 3: if the preceding term is odd; multiply by 3 and add 1 | step/rule 4: repeat steps until you arrive at 1 | fact: the sequence should ALWAYS end up at 1 if repeated. | . Algorithm to Start (Determining Whether a Number is Even or Odd) . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) if (varx %2 == 0): print(&quot;the number is even&quot;) else: print(&quot;the number is odd&quot;) # Run this cell to see how it works . How can we modify this code to match our goal . Hint: uses arithmetic operations | Hint: look at the steps of the equation and try and modify it to fit them | Must display all numbers used in it | . Solution . Step 1 . steps/rules 2 &amp; 3. | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) if (varx %2 == 0): varx == varx/2 # Change print to the function else: varx == varx * 3 + 1 # Change print to the function print(varx) . Step 2 . step/rule 4; here we add the loop | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 # Change print to the function else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 # Change print to the function print(varx) . Step 3 . Display all values throughout the algorithm | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) print(varx) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 print(varx) # add Display else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 print(varx) # add Display print(varx) # Final # Should be 1 every time . Takeaways . You can use code you&#39;ve previously wrote in order to make a project easier. | Breaking algorithms down into steps can make things easier and more simple. | . Hacks . create another algorithm using a famous mathematical algorithm such as the &quot;collatz conjecture.&quot; and explain your steps in a post on a blog. | . 3.11 Binary Search . Goals/Objectives: . detirmine number of iterations required to find vlue in data set. | explain requirements for binary search | . What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . About Binary Search: . Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated. | In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order | COLLEGE BOARD INDEX STARTS AT 1 NOT 0 | . Think about how you would you would try to find a certain number in this set. . One way would be to line up the numbers and count them individually untill you find the desired value. . When working with large data sets with lots of numbers, methods like these wont work . Instead, a Binary Search would be more effective. | . Here we can see the numbers are set in an increasing order. Setting numbers in an increasing or decreasing is needed for a binary search . Binary search is started with the middle number first Middle number is found by taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two | . | Binary Search can be represented using a tree as shown below | . . Heres an easy way to put it: . binary search fidns the desired element by continuously chopping the search area in half | say the element you are looking for is &#39;f&#39; | . [a b c d e f g h] . We would start in the middle at element &#39;d&#39; | becuase our target is greater than d we will eliminate everything left of &#39;d&#39; including &#39;d&#39; (chopping it in half) . [e f g h] is what now remains . again we would &#39;chop in half&#39; | say we iterate through &#39;g&#39; and &#39;h&#39;, our desired element is still not found so we would eliminate &#39;g; and &#39;h&#39; and continue the process | . [e f] . now we are down to 2 elements | &#39;chopping in half&#39; will give us our desired element | . [f] . | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 8 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . We have created a function called binary_search() function which takes two arguments - a list to be sorted and a number to be searched. . | We have declared two variables to store the lowest and highest values in the list. The lowest is assigned initial value to 0, the highest to len(list1) 1 and mid as 0. . | Next, we have declared the while loop with the condition that the lowest is equal and smaller than the highest. The while loop will iterate if the number has not been found yet. . | In the while loop, we find the mid value and compare the index value to the number we are searching for. . | If the value of the mid-index is smaller than n, we increase the mid value by 1 and assign it to the low. The search moves to the left side. . | Otherwise, if the value of mid index is larger than n, we decrease the mid value by 1 and assign it to the high. The search moves to the right side. . | If the n is equal to the mid value then return mid. . | This will happen until the low is equal and smaller than the high. . | If we reach at the end of the function, then the element is not present in the list. We return -1 to the calling function. . | . . Hacks . Using my example above and steps below, create your own iteration using binary search . Steps . Compare x with the middle element. | If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index. | Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half. | Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half. | . Homework Assignment (DUE FRIDAY 12/09 BY 5:00 PM) . Consider this situation: . You&#39;re playing a short game using a random number generator from 1 to 20 . On each turn, a player will generate 3 random numbers . | They get to keep the highest number that they generate as their score . | . | . | . import random # module for generating random item from a list nums = list(range(1, 21)) # list of numbers num1 = int(random.choice(nums)) # int takes the integer, random utilizes the module num2 = int(random.choice(nums)) # the three numbers are generated here num3 = int(random.choice(nums)) def end(): # procedure for endgame print(&quot;Okay I guess&quot;) rd = input(&quot;Are you ready? y/n&quot;) # useless prompt to initiate the game if rd == &quot;y&quot;: print(num1) print(&quot;continue?y/n&quot;) # basically a checkpoint cn = input() if cn == &quot;y&quot;: print(num2) print(&quot;continue?y/n&quot;) cn2 = input() if cn2 == &quot;y&quot;: print(num3) if num1 &gt; num2 and num1 &gt; num3: # checks if num1 is the greatest print(&quot;Your Score:&quot; , num1) else: if num2 &gt; num1 and num2 &gt; num3: # checks if num2 is the greatest print(&quot;Your Score:&quot; , num2) else: if num3 &gt; num1 and num3 &gt; num2: # checks if num3 is the greatest print(&quot;Your Score:&quot; , num3) else: end() else: end() else: end() . 13 continue?y/n 5 continue?y/n 9 Your Score: 13 .",

Logical Operators! . These types of operators don&#39;t necessarily deal with equivalent/non-equivalent values, but they rather work on operands to produce a singular boolean result . AND : returns TRUE if the operands around it are TRUE | OR : returns TRUE if at least one operand is TRUE | NOT : returns TRUE if the following boolean is FALSE | . Turn the following arithmetic phrases into either True or False statements as indicated USING LOGICAL OPERATORS . print(&quot;1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12:&quot;, 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12) # Output TRUE using OR ^ # Output FALSE using NOT print(&quot;24 &gt; 8:&quot;, not 24 &gt; 8) # Output FALSE using AND print(&quot;10 &gt; 20:&quot;, 10 &gt; 20 and False) . 1 &gt; 2 or 5 &lt; 12: True 24 &gt; 8: False 10 &gt; 20: False . Lesson Overview: 3.6 - Conditionals . Focusing on Selection . Selection: uses a condition that evaluates to true or false . Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false . Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task . Conditional Statements . Also known as &quot;if statements&quot; . Can be seen as if statements or if blocks . Can also be seen as if else statements or if else-blocks . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) . x is greater than y . x = 20 y = 10 if x &gt; y: print(&quot;x is greater than y&quot;) else: print(&quot;x is not greater than y&quot;) . x is greater than y . Participation . -Calculate the total sum of two numbers, if it is equal to 200, print 200, if otherwise, print the sum. . num1 = 100 num2 = 400 sum = num1 + num2 if sum == 200: print(&quot;yea 200&quot;) else: print(sum) . 500 .

            "content": "Lists . What are lists? . Lists: a sequence of variables . we can use lists to store multiple items into one variable | used to store collections of data | changeable, ordered, allow duplicates | . List examples in Python, JavaScript, and Pseudocode. . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;] print (fruits) . const fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;]; . fruits ← [apple, grape, strawberry] . Lists are just one of four collection data types in Python . Tuple: collection that is ordered, unchangeable, allows duplicates | Set: collection that is unordered, unchangeable, doesn&#39;t allow duplicates | Dictionary: collection that is ordered, changeable, doesn&#39;t allow duplicates | . Terms . Index: a term used to sort data in order to reference to an element in a list (allows for duplicates) | Elements: the values in the list assigned to an index | . fruits = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;grape&quot;, &quot;strawberry&quot;] index = 1 print (fruits[index]) . grape . Methods in Lists . Method Definition Example . append() | adds element to the end of the list | fruits.append(&quot;watermelon&quot;) | . index() | returns the index of the first element with the specified value | fruits.index(&quot;apple&quot;) | . insert() | adds element at given position | fruits.insert(1, &quot;watermelon&quot;) | . remove() | removes the first item with the specified value | fruits.remove(&quot;strawberry&quot;) | . reverse() | reverses the list order | fruits.reverse() | . sort() | sorts the list | fruits.sort() | . count() | returns the amount of elements with the specified value | fruits.count(&quot;apple&quot;) | . copy() | returns a copy of the list | fruits.copy() | . clear() | removes the elements from the list | fruits.clear() | . sports = [&quot;football&quot;, &quot;soccer&quot;, &quot;baseball&quot;, &quot;basketball&quot;] index = 0 # change the value &quot;soccer&quot; to &quot;hockey&quot; sports.remove(sports[index]) sports.insert(0, &quot;hockey&quot;) print(sports) .

[&#39;football&#39;, &#39;soccer&#39;, &#39;golf&#39;, &#39;baseball&#39;, &#39;basketball&#39;] . Iteration . Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There&#39;s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a &quot;for loop&quot;, using a &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, using a &quot;while loop&quot;, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the &#39;containers&#39; that store the data to iterate. . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . Iterator? Iterable? Iteration? . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration . | When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator . | Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. . | . Loops . Well, above is basically just printing them again, so how do we takes these iterators into something we can make use for? . | Loops take essentially what we did above and automates it, here are some examples. . | . Using the range() function . But wait, there&#39;s more . Need to save even more time? The above is useful for many occasions, but can get tedious fast, in this case, use range() . Else, elif, and break . For when 1 statement isn&#39;t enough . Else:when the condition does not meet, do statement()- Elif: when the condition does not meet, but meets another condition, do statement()&gt; Break:stop the loop . 2D Iteration . 2D Arrays . A 2D array is simply just a list of lists. The example below is technically correct but... Conventially 2D arrays are written like below. This is because 2D arrays are meant to be read in 2 dimensions (hence the name). Writing them like below makes them easier to visualize and understand. .

Sequencing is Important! . Changing the order of the steps changes the overall outcome, since every time the value assigned to a variable is changed, it overrides the last value which was assigned to the same variable. That is why it is important to track the value of variables, especially in code where the value is constantly changing. . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num1 = num2 + num3 # num1 is now 4 + 6, which is 10 num2 = num1 + num3 # num2 is now (the new num1) 10 + 6, which is 16 # output: num1 = 10, num2 = 16, num3 = 6 . VS . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num2 = num1 + num3 #num2 is now 8 num1 = num2 + num3 # num1 is now 14 # output: num1 = 14, num2 = 8, num3 = 6 . Tracking Variables . Tracking variables is a common question found on AP exams and is an important thing to keep in mind when writing any code. If the value of your variables changes a lot, not accounting for these changes can result in an unwanted outcome. . var1 = 9 var2 = 7 var3 = 2 #var = var1 + 5 #var2 = var1 - var3 #var1 = var2 #var3 = (var1 + var2) / 2 #var2 = 6 print(var1) print(var2) print(var3) .

Certain procedures may be used with strings and they vary from programming language to language Python examples . len() to find the length of a string . lower() to convert to lowercase . etc. Pseudocode examples . len() returns the length of a string . concat() returns a string made up of the concatenated strings ex. concat(&quot;string1&quot;, &quot;string2&quot;) would return string1string2 . substring() returns the characters from the string beginning at the at the first position to the last so an example of this would be substring (&quot;abcdefghijk&quot;, 2, 5) would print bcde (pseudocode starts at 1) . String Concatenation . What is string concatenation? . String concatenation is combining 2 or more strings to make a new strings in order to create a new string . concat() in pseudocode and varys from language to language can be used to combine to strings such as concat(&quot;cookie&quot;,&quot;monster&quot;) returns cookiemonster . Substrings . What is a substring? . A substring is a part of and already existing string. . In pseudocode substring() method is used for instance for concat(&quot;Mr.Mortenson is very handsome&quot; 1, 2) the system would return Mr (remember that pseudocode starts at 1) . Hacks . Find the result of the following problems. Then convert the pseudocode to working python code using your knowledge of python string operators. . Problem 1 .

            "content": "Section 3 Video 3 Notes and Planning . Arithmetic Operations in Programming . Link to Video . Arithmetic operations exist in most programming languages. . Include: Subtraction, Addition, Multiplication, Division, Getting the Remainder . All operations are represented by symbols. . | Subtraction: “-“ . | Ex: a - b . | Addition: “+” . | Ex: a + b . | Multiplication: “*“ . | Ex: a * b . | Division: / . | Ex: a / b . | Getting the Remainder: MOD . | Ex: a MOD b | . In all of these scenarios, a/b can be an expression or just a simple number. . Just like how numbers can be assigned to variables, a set of operations involving different values and numbers can also be assigned to a variable . Ex: . num1 ← 20 . num2 ← num1 + 98 . num3 ← num2 * num1 + 8 / num2 . Arithmetic operations in programming are performed in the same order as operations in mathematics. For example, operations in parentheses should be done first. . Idea for Hacks . A series of challenges and problems in the form of a quiz including arithmetic operations and expressions. . Possible Options: Students will clone a fastpages repository in order to complete the given assignments and interact with different elements. . Link to planning issue .",

            "content": "Trimester Final 1 Blog . . . . Q36 Store even numbers in evenList . Consider the following code segment, which is intended to store ten consecutive even integers, beginning with 2, in the list evenList. Assume that evenList is initially empty. . i ← 1 . REPEAT 10 TIMES . { . &lt; MISSING CODE &gt; . } . Which of the following can be used to replace &lt; MISSING CODE &gt; so that the code segment works as intended? . My Answer: . i ← i + 1 . APPEND(evenList, 2 * i) . Correct Answer: . APPEND(evenList, 2 * i) . i ← i + 1 . For the first iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 2, is appended to evenList, and then i is incremented to 2. For the second iteration of the loop, twice the value of i, or 4, is appended to the list, and then i is incremented to 3. This continues eight more times, appending the next eight even numbers to evenList. This code segment will generate the list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]. . . . Q39 Valid index for wordList . The list wordList contains a list of 10 string values. Which of the following is a valid index for the list? (4, 2.5, -2, “hello”) . My Answer: “hello” . Correct Answer: 4 . While the list elements are strings, the indices of a list are typically nonnegative integers. . . . Q42 Value of sum after IF ELSE IF . What is the value of sum after the code segment is executed? . . My Answer: 12 . Correct Answer: 16 . The first three statements assign values to the variables. Since num1 &lt; num2 evaluates to false, the body of the ELSE block is executed and num3 is assigned the value 4. Since num2 ≥ num3 evaluates to true, the body of the second IF block is executed and num1 is assigned the value 8. Lastly, sum is assigned the value of 8 + 4 + 4, or 16. . . . Q43 Value of x after REPEAT UNTIL block . What is the value of result after the code segment is executed? . . My Answer: 6 . Correct Answer: 15 . The variables x and result are initialized to 0. Inside the loop, result is increased by x and x is increased by 1. The loop terminates when x exceeds 5. Therefore, result is assigned the sum of the integers from 0 to 5, or 15. . . . Q48 Which variables are equal to 50 after assignments . Consider the following code segment. . x ← 25 . y ← 50 . z ← 75 . x ← y . y ← z . z ← x . Which of the variables have the value 50 after executing the code segment? . My Answer: z y and z . Correct Answer: x and z . The first three statements assign values to the variables. The fourth statement assigns the value of y (which is 50) to x. The fifth statement assigns the value of z (which is 75) to y. The sixth statement assigns the value of x (which is 50) to z. Therefore, x and z both have the value 50. . . . Q50 Use concat and prefix to form initials . Consider the following procedures for string manipulation. . Procedure Call Explanation . concat(str1, str2) | Returns a single string consisting of str1 followed by str2. For example, concat(&quot;key&quot;, &quot;board&quot;) returns &quot;keyboard&quot;. | . prefix(str, length) | Returns the first length characters of str or str if length is greater than the number of characters in str. For example, prefix(&quot;delivery&quot;, 3) returns &quot;del&quot; and prefix(&quot;delivery&quot;, 100) returns &quot;delivery&quot;. | . The variable initials is to be assigned a string consisting of the first letter of the string firstName followed by the first letter of the string lastName. Which of the following assigns the correct string to initials ? . My Answer: . initials ← prefix(concat(firstName, lastName), 2) . Correct Answer: . initials ← concat(prefix(firstName, 1), prefix(lastName, 1)) . This statement will correctly form the initials. It uses calls to prefix to obtain the first letters of each name, then uses a call to concat to concatenate the two letters in the correct order. .",

As always, I’m still learning and there’s much room for improvement. . . . . Questions . 1.4 (2/3) . . Q1 (Correct): In the following code segment, score and penalty are initially positive integers. The code segment is intended to reduce the value of score by penalty. However, if doing so would cause score to be negative, score should be assigned the value 0. For example, if score is 20 and penalty is 5, the code segment should set score to 15. If score is 20 and penalty is 30, score should be set to 0. The code segment does not work as intended. . Line 1: IF(score - penalty &lt; 0) . Line 2: { . Line 3: score ← score - penalty . Line 4: } . Line 5: ELSE . Line 6: { . Line 7: score ← 0 . Line 8: } . Which of the following changes can be made so that the code segment works as intended? . Answer: Interchaning lines 3 and 7. . Interchanging lines 3 and 7 ensures that if reducing score by penalty results in a negative value, score is set to 0. Otherwise, score is reduced by penalty. . . Q2 (Incorrect): The following procedure is intended to return true if the list of numbers myList contains only positive numbers and is intended to return false otherwise. The procedure does not work as intended. . PROCEDURE allPositive(myList) . { . index ← 1 . len ← LENGTH(myList) . REPEAT len TIMES . { . IF(myList[index] &gt; 0) . { . RETURN(true) . } . index ← index + 1 . } . RETURN(false) . } . My Answer : [1, 2, 3] . The procedure begins to traverse the list and immediately encounters the positive value 1. At this point, the procedure returns true as intended for this list. . Correct Answer: [-1, 0, 1] . The procedure traverses this list and eventually encounters the positive value 1. At this point, the procedure returns true when it should return false because the list does not contain only positive values. . . Q3 (Correct): A homework assignment consists of 10 questions. The assignment is graded as follows. . . Let numCorrect represent the number of correct answers for a particular student. The following code segment is intended to display the appropriate grade based on numCorrect. The code segment does not work as intended in all cases. . . For which of the following values of numCorrect does the code segment NOT display the intended grade? . Answer(s): 8: When numCorrect is 8, the condition numCorrect &gt; 7 evaluates to true and the condition numCorrect ≥ 9 evaluates to false. Therefore “check minus” is displayed instead of the intended “check plus”. . 6: When numCorrect is 6, the condition numCorrect &gt; 7 evaluates to false. Therefore “check” is displayed instead of the intended “check minus”. . . . Click here to access additional resources for Collaboration, Program Function/Purpose, and Program Design/Development. .",

The quiz includes 3 multiple-choice questions and 1 free-response question. Working with different elements such as buttons and images was easy for the most part and didn’t present any challenges. Making the free response question was a bit tricky. I had to play around with its assigned block and the text input function to make it work. . # Default Notation . onEvent(&quot;textinput&quot;, &quot;change&quot;, function(event) { . }); . # My Edit . onEvent(&quot;text_input1&quot;, &quot;change&quot;, function(event) { . }); . . Another extra feature that I added to my app was the usage of retrieving data from a text input. By adding the following code to the text input function, I managed to display the entered number from the free-response question: . # Default Notation . onEvent(&quot;textinput&quot;, &quot;change&quot;, function(event) { . setText(&quot;id&quot;, + getText(&quot;textinput&quot;)); . | setScreen(&quot;id&quot;); . | . }); . # My Edit . onEvent(&quot;text_input1&quot;, &quot;change&quot;, function(event) { . setText(&quot;response&quot;, &quot;Wow, only &quot; + getText(&quot;text_input1&quot;) + &quot;?&quot;); . | setScreen(&quot;r1&quot;); . | . }); . . . I also added to add “wrong answer” screens which appear if the user selects wrong answers. I simply assigned these screens to appropriate buttons. . . . Currently I’m trying to figure out a way to make the code a bit shorter using conditionals, but I don’t think it’ll work since I’m not that familiar with JavaScript. . . Update . I decided to use the dropdown function as a way to display a body of text. This dropdown box presents the “prize” to the user. . . . The trickiest part of developing this quiz was displaying the final score at the end. I used a variables and individual functions to make it work. The individual functions largely increase the size of the code and I couldn’t find a way to shorten them. Each individual function is assigned to a button. Buttons with correct answers add one point to the initial variable and buttons with incorrect answers subtract one point. . # setting the variable . var score = 0; . setText(&quot;text_input&quot;, &quot;Score = &quot; + score); . onEvent(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function(event) { # in this case, id is a correct answer . score = score + 1; . | setText(&quot;text_input&quot;, &quot;Score = &quot; + score); # one point added . | . }); . onEvent(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;click&quot;, function(event) { # in this case, id is an incorrect answer . score = score - 1; . | setText(&quot;text_input&quot;, &quot;Score = &quot; + score); # one point subtracted . | . }); . . .

            "content": "Background . Too often we think the goal of a laboratory is to “get an answer”. Just as a graph with one point does not tell us much, calculating a single value can be misleading. Although the accuracy of this value can be determined if a standard value is known, the precision or reproducibility cannot. One way to picture this precision is to graph the data and fit the data points with a best fit line. A best fit line should be drawn with as many points above it as below it, the closer the data points are to the line the more precise and reliable your results. . The equation describing the graph also shows how variables are related, allowing new values to be extrapolated or calculated from the graph. An additional step called “linearizing” helps determine the functional relationship between variables. . The objective of the linearizing process is to change the independent or dependent variable, for example change x to 1/x, so that the resulting graph is linear. So then, the equation describing the linear graph becomes; . y = slope (1/x) + intercept . Credits to Mr. Liao .",

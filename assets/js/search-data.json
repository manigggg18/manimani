This greeting code uses a simple print command. . print(&quot;Hello, please go ahead and try to don&#39;t fail the quiz!&quot;) # a greeting . The following code sequences provide a quiz about the basics of Python by using those basics: . import: Includes functions that were previously developed. . def: def/function/procedure; used for defining a function usually at the beginning of a sequence. . prompt: A message output to the user to describe the input requested. . msg: Short for message, used to capture input command. . Questions, answers and responses are defined using these basics. . Rsp and if/else commands will be used for evaluating scores. .

Hello, manimani running /bin/python3 You will be asked 3 questions. Question: Are you ready to take a test? Answer: Yes Question: What command is used to include other functions that were previously developed? import is correct! Question: What command is used to evaluate correct or incorrect response in this example? if is correct! Question: Each &#39;if&#39; command contains an &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition? expression is correct! manimani you scored 3/3 .

Client | Entertainment/Toy manufacturing Companies (Main option: Hasbro) | . Target Consumer | High school students of all ages living with their parents/guardians | . Designer(s) | Mani Taleban | . Problem Statement | A high school student can only use their phone and computer device for education and school assignments. The student’s parents have forbidden them from accessing their phone and computer device for entertainment purposes. The student needs approximately 10 minutes between assignments to do an entertaining activity in order to become fully operational again and avoid severe boredom. The student always experiences boredom during the 10-minute breaks between assignments. The student finds it necessary to find a solution, because they cannot continue operating correctly without having some source of entertainment and refreshment. | . Design Statement | Create an entertaining, refreshing, and engaging activity/game | . Criteria | Should be playable for approximately 10 minutes . | Should have a scoring system . | Should be both single-player and multi-player . | Should increase the level of dopamine . | | . Constraints | Should only use common office supplies . | Should cost no money . | Should fit in an office-sized room environment . | Creating the activity/game should take no longer than 5 minutes . | | .",
